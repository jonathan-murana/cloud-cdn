//This class models the finite LRU stack approach for introducing temporal locality
//into our workload. We use two different approaches to model temporal locality: Static 
//and Dynamic. The static approach seems to introduce more (but not neccessarily realistic) 
//temporal locality than the dynamic approach. This class is actually used inside stream.*
//while the requests are being generated.
